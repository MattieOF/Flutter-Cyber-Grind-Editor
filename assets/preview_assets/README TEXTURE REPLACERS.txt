notes for replacing each texture:

FOR ALL: png extension only! i.e block.jpg WON'T work

block: just replace block.png. 
zapgrid: zapgrid.png
skybox: skybox.png. MUST BE IN VERTICAL CUBEMAP LAYOUT. you can use the provdided skybox_concat.py script to convert 6 images to the vertical image. requires Pillow python library. if you have a panorama, use a tool like https://jaxry.github.io/panorama-to-cubemap/ to convert it to 6 seperate files

the models are also technically replaceable.
